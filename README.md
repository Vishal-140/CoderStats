# CoderStats - Coding Profile Analytics Platform

## Project Overview
CoderStats is a web application that aggregates and visualizes coding profiles from multiple competitive programming platforms. It helps users track their programming journey across different coding platforms in one unified dashboard.

## Key Features
1. **Authentication System**
   - Email/Password login
   - Google OAuth integration
   - Secure user profile management

2. **Multi-Platform Integration**
   - LeetCode stats tracking
   - CodeForces performance metrics
   - GeeksForGeeks (GFG) progress monitoring

3. **Dashboard Features**
   - Problems solved counter across platforms
   - Rating progress visualization
   - Difficulty-wise problem breakdown
   - Recent submissions timeline
   - Performance heatmap

4. **User Profile Management**
   - College/Institution details
   - Platform usernames linking
   - Profile photo integration

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase
  - Authentication
  - Firestore Database
  - Real-time updates
- **External APIs**
  - LeetCode API
  - CodeForces API
  - GeeksForGeeks API

## Purpose
The platform aims to help:
- Competitive programmers track their progress
- Students showcase their coding achievements
- Recruiters evaluate candidates' coding profiles
- Users identify areas for improvement across platforms

## Target Users
- Competitive programmers
- College students
- Software developers
- Coding enthusiasts







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
